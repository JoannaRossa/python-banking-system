class Maintenance:
    # can turn on/off the systems execution trace
  
    # An execution trace is a log of the systemâ€™s functions entered, 
    # along with the time entered, during the use of the system by the user. 
    
    # In order to associate a particular trace with the user that generated it, 
    # the user is identified at the head of the execution trace.
    
    # When the trace switch is set to ON, an execution trace is written, for a given account, in an external file 
    
    # that can be printed out at a later time by the maintenance person. 
    
    # No traces are generated when the switch is in the OFF state.
